I am a data analyst and researcher based in Kelowna, British Columbia.

I am currently studying Data Analytics and Marketing at Okanagan College.

I worked as a Research Officer at [CTS Global Equity Group](https://www.ctsglobalgroup.com/) from 2015 to 2021, focusing on market sentiment, risk management, and the fundamental and technical analyses of global equity markets. My efforts contributed to generating alpha returns.
